##Running the Flask App##

First, install the required python packages with 
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Then navigate to the `Flask` directory and run 
`python3 run.py`

Once this is done, you can view the app at 
`http://0.0.0.0:5000/`

Moreover, since the `debug` flag is set in `run.py`, changing any python file will automatically update the app while running.
