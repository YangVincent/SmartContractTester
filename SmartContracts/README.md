# Smart Contracts
A collection of smart contracts including the infamous DAO bug.

### singletons/ ###

This directory contains an assortment of unrelated smart contracts. 
Each contract is part of the Solidity tutorial at [https://github.com/fivedogit/solidity-baby-steps](https://github.com/fivedogit/solidity-baby-steps). 

### dao/ ###

The famous `DAO` bug is a by-product of the contained solidity files. I've gone through the DAO repository and simply pulled all the .sol files, but the repository is located at [https://github.com/slockit/DAO](https://github.com/slockit/DAO).
